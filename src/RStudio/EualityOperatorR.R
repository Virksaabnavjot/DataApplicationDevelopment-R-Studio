# Comparison of logicals
TRUE == FALSE

# Comparison of numerics
-6 * 14 != 17-101

# Comparison of character strings
"useR" == "user"

# Compare a logical with a numeric
TRUE == 1

#Awesome! Since TRUE coerces to 1 under the hood, 
#TRUE == 1 evaluates to TRUE. Make sure not to mix up == (comparison) 
#and = (assignment), == is what need to check the equality of R objects.
